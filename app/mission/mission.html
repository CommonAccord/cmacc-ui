  <h2>Bringing the World to Agreement</h2>

  <p>The phrase may sound flip. But it is supported by a solid observation:</p>

  <ul>
	<li>The methods of open source software eliminate the friction of scaling agreement from one to
	  two to many. With full flexibility and traceability.</li>
	<li>Inheritance (particularly multiple inheritance) allows an idea to be carried forward and
	  reused, carrying forward its full history.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Git (and Github) allows the publication, iteration, documentation, collaboration of complex
	ideas. It is mostly used for coding software. But the tools are equally well suited to legal
	text.</p>

  <p>The reason lawyers do not work with source is mostly historical accident: lawyering got automated
	before lawyers were networked.</p>

  <p>So, which kinds of agreement? All kinds.</p>

  <ul>
	<li><em>Bring the parties to share agreement</em>. This is an answer to the my-form vs your-form
	  game - where I have to waste time reviewing your document or you have to waste time reading
	  mine. We can short-cut that by starting with a shared form. CommonAccord is a place to put
	  that agreement and links lead you to it.</li>

	<li><em>Bringing new agreement to the world</em>. There are many agreements that don't yet exist
	  - they involve changing areas of law or are subject to wide divergence of opinion. Git and
	  modularity are the fastest, most robust path to codification, and the process leaves a trail
	  of knowledge that exposes the issues and links to the experts. For instance in the evolving
	  field of privacy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A World Without Paperwork</h2>


  <p>It should be be possible to do business, to live one's life, without having to click and sign away
	who knows what.</p>

  <p>To visit a doctor or website, to order something, borrow, get paid for work, without having to
	become a lawyer or hire one.</p>

  <p>Paperwork, intended to state the usual, should be in the background, where it used to be. With
	crowd-sourcing and traceability, it can go back to the background, at a URL, like law or
	Wikipedia. Even as it becomes ever better fit to us.</p>

  <h2>Local Decision</h2>

  <p>One of the most widespread, and inadequately discussed, ills of the modern era is that the
	decisions that effect us mostly get made far away. Improvements in manufacturing, commerce,
	government and technology often have the effect of moving the decision-making elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Whatever the merits of those making the decisions, they don't know us or our circumstances and
	their interests may not be aligned with ours.</p>

  <p>Tools for resilient society should increase independence to act and decide locally.</p>

  <p>To achieve this, the system must be simple, open, peer-to-peer.</p>

  <p>Open is, of course, the mantra of the open source movement, simple makes it available to the rest
	of us and for the rest of our lives.</p>

  <p>While the universality of CommonAccord will likely drive some kinds centralization, it's
	simplicity has the potential to reduce centralization. It is hard to see which of these two effects
	will predominate - and it may be that they cascade.</p>

  <p>Some, hoped-for forms of decentralization include:</p>

  <ul>
	<li>We can make our own rules. The "law commons" of David Bollier.</li>
	<li>We can hold up our rules to others. A conversation with Herbert Kawadza about "Ubuntu" (the
	  original, not the software).</li>
	<li>We on the front line can roll our own. The unifying theme of CommonAccord is that I, as
	  non-technical user, should be able to achieve my ends. I know the problem, I'll take
	  responsibility for the solution. Depending on others involves filters and delays that reduce my
	  bull to boullion (Le Carre). This is related to the Stallman notion of free speech. Applied to
	  non-programmers. The hubless nature of CommonAccord is consistent with blockchain ideas of
	  independence.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Open source software, particularly as practiced using flexible forking of git, is community
	action by direct democracy. The experience and methods can be transposed into other domains.</p>
