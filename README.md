# cmacc-ui

This is an AngularJS frontend for CommonAccord. It is under development, and currently isn't
deployed anywhere public for viewing.

This application can be deployed locally for viewing. For notes on how to get this project set up
locally, see the Developer Setup wiki page.

# TODO

- *CommonAccord API*: This UI won't be functional until the CommonAccord API is changed to return
   non-HTML documents.
- *Tests*: make some and make them work.


To become part of the discussion on how the API or UI should be designed, please email the
CommonAccord mailing list.
